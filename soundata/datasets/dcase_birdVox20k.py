    Version 1.0

    *Description*
        The BirdVox-DCASE-20k dataset contains 20,000 ten-second audio recordings. These recordings come from ROBIN autonomous recording units, placed near Ithaca, NY, USA during the fall 2015. They were captured on the night of September 23rd, 2015, by six different sensors, originally numbered 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10.
        Out of these 20,000 recording, 10,017 (50.09%) contain at least one bird vocalization (either song, call, or chatter).
        The dataset is a derivative work of the BirdVox-full-night dataset [1], containing almost as much data but formatted into ten-second excerpts rather than ten-hour full night recordings.
        In addition, the BirdVox-DCASE-20k dataset is provided as a development set in the context of the "Bird Audio Detection" challenge, organized by DCASE (Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events) and the IEEE Signal Processing Society.
        The dataset can be used, among other things, for the development and evaluation of bioacoustic classification models.

    *Audio Files Included*
        20,000 ten-second audio recordings (see description above) in WAV format. The wav folder contains the recordings as WAV files, sampled at 44,1 kHz, with a single channel (mono). The original sample rate was 24 kHz.

    *Meta-data Files Included*
        A table containing a binary label "hasbird" associated to every recording in BirdVox-DCASE-20k is available on the website of the DCASE "Bird Audio Detection" challenge: http://machine-listening.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/bird-audio-detection-challenge/
        These labels were automatically derived from the annotations of avian flight call events in the BirdVox-full-night dataset.

    *Please Acknowledge UrbanSound8K in Academic Research*
        When BirdVox-70k is used for academic research, we would highly appreciate it if  scientific publications of works partly based on this dataset cite the  following publication:

        The creation of this dataset was supported by NSF grants 1125098 (BIRDCAST) and 1633259 (BIRDVOX), a Google Faculty Award, the Leon Levy Foundation, and two anonymous donors.
