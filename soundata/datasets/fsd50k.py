    *FSD50K: an Open Dataset of Human-Labeled Sound Events*

    *Created By:*
        Eduardo Fonseca, Xavier Favory, Jordi Pons, Frederic Font, Xavier Serra.
        Music Technology Group, Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona). Version 1.0

    *Description:*
        FSD50K is an open dataset of human-labeled sound events containing 51,197 Freesound clips unequally
        distributed in 200 classes drawn from the AudioSet Ontology. FSD50K has been created at the Music Technology Group
        of Universitat Pompeu Fabra.

    *Audio Files Included:*
        * FSD50K contains 51,197 audio clips from Freesound, totalling 108.3 hours of multi-labeled audio.
        * The audio content is composed mainly of sound events produced by physical sound sources and production mechanisms,
          including human sounds, sounds of things, animals, natural sounds, musical instruments and more. The vocabulary
          can be inspected in vocabulary.csv.
        * Clips are of variable length from 0.3 to 30s, due to the diversity of the sound classes and the preferences of
          Freesound users when recording sounds.
        * All clips are provided as uncompressed PCM 16 bit 44.1 kHz mono audio files.

    *Annotations Included:*
        * The dataset encompasses 200 sound classes (144 leaf nodes and 56 intermediate nodes) hierarchically organized
          with a subset of the AudioSet Ontology. Please refer to the included vocabulary.csv file for a complete list of
          considered classes.
        * The acoustic material has been manually labeled by humans following a data labeling
          process using the Freesound Annotator platform.
        * Ground truth labels are provided at the clip-level (i.e., weak labels).
        * Note: All classes in FSD50K are represented in AudioSet, except Crash cymbal, Human group actions, Human voice,
          Respiratory sounds, and Domestic sounds, home sounds.
        * Note: We use a slightly different format than AudioSet for the naming of class labels in order to avoid potential
          problems with spaces, commas, etc. Example: we use Accelerating_and_revving_and_vroom instead of the original
          Accelerating, revving, vroom. You can go back to the original AudioSet naming using the information provided in
          vocabulary.csv (class label and mid for the 200 classes of FSD50K) and the AudioSet Ontology specification.


    *Organization:*
        FSD50K is split in two subsets: the developement (dev) and the evaluation (eval) sets.
        Especifications of both subsets is detailed below:

    * Dev set:
        * 40,966 audio clips totalling 80.4 hours of audio
        * Avg duration/clip: 7.1s
        * 114,271 smeared labels (i.e., labels propagated in the upwards direction to the root of the ontology)
        * Labels are correct but could be occasionally incomplete
        * A train/validation split is provided. If a different split is used, it should be specified for reproducibility
          and fair comparability of results

    * Eval set:
        * 10,231 audio clips totalling 27.9 hours of audio
        * Avg duration/clip: 9.8s
        * 38,596 smeared labels
        * Eval set is labeled exhaustively (labels are correct and complete for the considered vocabulary)

    *Ground-truth Files Included:*
        FSD50K ground-truth is represented through the following file structure:

    * dev.csv:
        Each row (i.e. audio clip) of dev.csv contains the following information:

        * fname:
            The file name without the .wav extension, e.g., the fname 64760 corresponds to the file 64760.wav
            in disk. This number is the Freesound id. We always use Freesound ids as filenames.

        * labels:
            The class labels (i.e., the ground truth). Note these class labels are smeared, i.e., the labels
            have been propagated in the upwards direction to the root of the ontology. More details about the label
            smearing process can be found in Appendix D of our paper.

        * mids:
            The Freebase identifiers corresponding to the class labels, as defined in the AudioSet Ontology
            specification.

        * split:
            Whether the clip belongs to train or val (see paper for details on the proposed split)


    * eval.csv:
        Rows in eval.csv follow the same format as dev.csv, except that there is no split column.

    *Metadata Files Included:*
        To allow a variety of analysis and approaches with FSD50K, we provide the following metadata:

    * class_info_FSD50K.json:
        Python dictionary where each entry corresponds to one sound class and  contains: FAQs
        utilized during the annotation of the class, examples (representative audio clips), and verification_examples
        (audio clips presented to raters during annotation as a quality control mechanism). Audio clips are described by
        the Freesound id. Note: It may be that some of these examples are not included in the FSD50K release.


    * dev_clips_info_FSD50K.json:
        Python dictionary where each entry corresponds to one dev clip and contains: title,
        description, tags, clip license, and the uploader name. All these metadata are provided by the uploader.


    * eval_clips_info_FSD50K.json:
        Same as above, but with eval clips.


    * pp_pnp_ratings.json:
        Python dictionary where each entry corresponds to one clip in the dataset and contains
        the PP/PNP ratings for the labels associated with the clip. More specifically, these ratings are gathered for the
        labels validated in the validation task. This file includes 59,485 labels for the 51,197 clips in FSD50K.
        Out of these labels:

            * 56,095 labels have inter-annotator agreement (PP twice, or PNP twice). Each of these combinations can be
              occasionally accompanied by other (non-positive) ratings.

            * 3390 labels feature other rating configurations such as i) only one PP rating and one PNP rating (and nothing
              else). This can be considered inter-annotator agreement at the "Present" level; ii) only one PP rating (and
              nothing else); iii) only one PNP rating (and nothing else).

        Ratings' legend: PP=1; PNP=0.5; U=0; NP=-1.

        Note: The PP/PNP ratings have been provided in the validation task. Subsequently, a subset of these clips
        corresponding to the eval set was exhaustively labeled in the refinement task, hence receiving additional labels
        in many cases. For these eval clips, you might want to check their labels in eval.csv in order to have more info
        about their audio content.


    *collection folder:*
        This folder contains metadata for what we call the sound collection format. This format consists of
        the raw annotations gathered, featuring all generated class labels without any restriction.
        We provide the collection format to make available some annotations that do not appear in the FSD50K ground truth
        release. This typically happens in the case of classes for which we gathered human-provided annotations, but that
        were discarded in the FSD50K release due to data scarcity (more specifically, they were merged with their parents).
        In other words, the main purpose of the collection format is to make available annotations for tiny classes.
        The format of these files in analogous to that of the files in FSD50K.ground_truth/. A couple of examples show the
        differences between collection and ground truth formats:

        * clip:  labels_in_collection - labels_in_ground_truth

            * 51690:  Owl - Bird,Wild_Animal,Animal

            * 190579:  Toothbrush,Electric_toothbrush - Domestic_sounds_and_home_sounds

        In the first example, raters provided the label Owl. However, due to data scarcity, Owl labels were merged into
        their parent Bird. Then, labels Wild_Animal,Animal were added via label propagation (smearing). The second example
        shows one of the most extreme cases, where raters provided the labels Electric_toothbrush,Toothbrush, which both
        had few data. Hence, they were merged into Toothbrush's parent, which unfortunately is Domestic_sounds_and_home_sounds
        (a rather vague class containing a variety of children sound classes).

        Note: Labels in the collection format are not smeared.

        Note: While in FSD50K's ground truth the vocabulary encompasses 200 classes (common for dev and eval), since the
        collection format is composed of raw annotations, the vocabulary here is much larger (over 350 classes), and it is
        slightly different in dev and eval.
