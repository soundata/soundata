        | Tampere University of Technology.

    Version 1.0

    *Description:*
        MAESTRO real development contains 49 real-life audio files from 5 different acoustic scenes, each of them from 3 to 5 minutes long.
        The other 26 files are kept for evaluation purposes on the DCASE task 4 B. The distribution of files per scene is the following:
        cafe restaurant 10 files, city center 10 files, residential_area 11 files, metro station 9 files and grocery store 9 files.
        The total duration of the development dataset is 97 minutes and 4 seconds.

        The audio files contain sounds from the following classes:

        - announcement
        - birds singing
        - breakes squeaking
        - car
        - cash register
        - children voices
        - coffee machine
        - cutlery/dishes
        - door opens/closes
        - footsteps
        - furniture dragging

        The real life-recordings used in this study include a subset of the TUT Sound Events 2016 and a subset of TUT Sound Events 2017.

In this work, we propose a novel annotation workflow that leverages the efficiency of crowdsourcing weak labels, and uses a high number of annotators to produce reliable and objective strong labels. The weak labels are collected in a highly redundant setup, to allow reconstruction of the temporal information. To obtain reliable labels, the annotators' competence is estimated using MACE (Multi-Annotator Competence Estimation) and incorporated into the strong labels estimation through weighing of individual opinions. We show that the proposed method produces consistently reliable strong annotations not only for synthetic audio mixtures, but also for audio recordings of real everyday environments. While only a maximum 80\% coincidence with the complete and correct reference annotations was obtained for synthetic data, these results are explained by an extended study of how polyphony and SNR levels affect the identification rate of the sound events by the annotators. On real data, even though the estimated annotators' competence is significantly lower and the coincidence with reference labels is under 69\%, the proposed majority opinion approach produces reliable aggregated strong labels in comparison with the more difficult task of crowdsourcing directly strong labels."
