    *Description:*
        FSDnoisy18k is an audio dataset collected with the aim of fostering the investigation of label noise in sound
        event classification. It contains 42.5 hours of audio across 20 sound classes, including a small amount of
        manually-labeled data and a larger quantity of real-world noisy data.

    What follows is a summary of the most basic aspects of FSDnoisy18k. For a complete description of FSDnoisy18k,
    make sure to check:

        * The FSDnoisy18k companion site: http://www.eduardofonseca.net/FSDnoisy18k/
        * The description provided in Section 2 of our ICASSP 2019 paper

    FSDnoisy18k is an audio dataset collected with the aim of fostering the investigation of label noise in sound
    event classification. It contains 42.5 hours of audio across 20 sound classes, including a small amount of
    manually-labeled data and a larger quantity of real-world noisy data.

    The source of audio content is Freesound—a sound sharing site created an maintained by the Music Technology Group
    hosting over 400,000 clips uploaded by its community of users, who additionally provide some basic metadata
    (e.g., tags, and title). The 20 classes of FSDnoisy18k are drawn from the AudioSet Ontology and are selected based
    on data availability as well as on their suitability to allow the study of label noise.
    The 20 classes are: "Acoustic guitar", "Bass guitar", "Clapping", "Coin (dropping)", "Crash cymbal", "Dishes,
    pots, and pans", "Engine", "Fart", "Fire", "Fireworks", "Glass", "Hi-hat", "Piano", "Rain", "Slam", "Squeak",
    "Tearing", "Walk, footsteps", "Wind", and "Writing". FSDnoisy18k was created with the Freesound Annotator,
    which is a platform for the collaborative creation of open audio datasets.

    We defined a clean portion of the dataset consisting of correct and complete labels. The remaining portion is
    referred to as the noisy portion. Each clip in the dataset has a single ground truth label (singly-labeled data).

    The clean portion of the data consists of audio clips whose labels are rated as present in the clip and
    predominant (almost all with full inter-annotator agreement), meaning that the label is correct and, in most
    cases, there is no additional acoustic material other than the labeled class. A few clips may contain some
    additional sound events, but they occur in the background and do not belong to any of the 20 target classes.
    This is more common for some classes that rarely occur alone, e.g., “Fire”, “Glass”, “Wind” or “Walk, footsteps”.

    The noisy portion of the data consists of audio clips that received no human validation. In this case, they are
    categorized on the basis of the user-provided tags in Freesound. Hence, the noisy portion features a certain
    amount of label noise.
    
    *Included files and statistics:*
        * FSDnoisy18k contains 18,532 audio clips (42.5h) unequally distributed in the 20 aforementioned classes drawn from the AudioSet Ontology.
        * The audio clips are provided as uncompressed PCM 16 bit, 44.1 kHz, mono audio files.
        * The audio clips are of variable length ranging from 300ms to 30s, and each clip has a single ground truth label (singly-labeled data).
        * The dataset is split into a test set and a train set. The test set is drawn entirely from the clean portion, while the remainder of data forms the train set.
        * The train set is composed of 17,585 clips (41.1h) unequally distributed among the 20 classes. It features a clean subset and a noisy subset. In terms of number of clips their proportion is 10%/90%, whereas in terms of duration the proportion is slightly more extreme (6%/94%). The per-class percentage of clean data within the train set is also imbalanced, ranging from 6.1% to 22.4%. The number of audio clips per class ranges from 51 to 170, and from 250 to 1000 in the clean and noisy subsets, respectively. Further, a noisy small subset is defined, which includes an amount of (noisy) data comparable (in terms of duration) to that of the clean subset.
        * The test set is composed of 947 clips (1.4h) that belong to the clean portion of the data. Its class distribution is similar to that of the clean subset of the train set. The number of per-class audio clips in the test set ranges from 30 to 72. The test set enables a multi-class classification problem.
        * FSDnoisy18k is an expandable dataset that features a per-class varying degree of types and amount of label noise. The dataset allows investigation of label noise as well as other approaches, from semi-supervised learning, e.g., self-training to learning with minimal supervision.


    *Additional code:*
        We've released the code for our ICASSP 2019 paper at https://github.com/edufonseca/icassp19. The framework
        comprises all the basic stages: feature extraction, training, inference and evaluation. After loading the
        FSDnoisy18k dataset, log-mel energies are computed and a CNN baseline is trained and evaluated. The code also
        allows to test four noise-robust loss functions. Please check our paper for more details.

    *Label noise characteristics:*
        FSDnoisy18k features real label noise that is representative of audio data retrieved from the web,
        particularly from Freesound. The analysis of a per-class, random, 15% of the noisy portion of FSDnoisy18k
        revealed that roughly 40% of the analyzed labels are correct and complete, whereas 60% of the labels show
        some type of label noise. Please check the FSDnoisy18k companion site for a detailed characterization of
        the label noise in the dataset, including a taxonomy of label noise for singly-labeled data as well as a
        per-class description of the label noise.
