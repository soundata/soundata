    Version 1.0

    *Description*
        The Warblr dataset consists of 10,000 ten-second audio files, collected via the Warblr app from users across the UK in 2015-2016.
        Using a classification method by Stowell and Plumbley (2014a), this app aims to identify bird species from user-submitted recordings.
        The dataset, inclusive of various human and environmental noises, is broadly distributed over different times and seasons but has biases towards mornings, weekends, and populated areas. Despite having initial automated bird species estimates, the recordings underwent manual annotation due to precision inadequacies for establishing ground-truth data.
        The dataset proves instrumental for research and development in bird species detection amidst variable noise conditions.

    *Audio Files Included*
        10,000 ten-second audio recordings in WAV format, amassed through the Warblr app during 2015-2016 from users throughout the UK.

    *Meta-data Files Included*
        A table containing a binary label "hasbird" associated to every recording in Warblr is available on the website of the DCASE "Bird Audio Detection" challenge: http://machine-listening.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/bird-audio-detection-challenge/

    *Please Acknowledge Warblr in Academic Research*
        When the Warblr dataset is employed for academic research, we sincerely request that scientific publications of works partially based on this dataset cite the following publication:

        The creation and curating of this dataset were possible through the participation and contributions of the general public using the Warblr app, enabling a comprehensive collection of bird sound recordings from various regions within the UK during 2015-2016.
